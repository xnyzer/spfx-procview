### F-001a — Provider contract, registry, test pipeline

_Part of F-001 — Provider interface + Signavio provider. Completed 2026-09-29._

**What:** Types for the provider contract and parse result (success with `imageUrl`,
`hubUrl`, `modelId`; failure with an error code), a registry that trims input, rejects
empty input and asks each provider; first Jest test in the project.

**Files:** `src/providers/types.ts`, `src/providers/registry.ts`,
`src/providers/registry.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** —

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] `just check` runs ≥ 1 real Jest test (`Total` > 0) — `Total: 6`, all green
- [x] A deliberately failing assertion makes `just check` fail (then reverted) —
      `Failures: 1`, exit 1; file restored and verified identical
- [x] Empty/whitespace input → `empty`; input no provider claims → `unsupported`
- [x] Registry tested with a stub provider (no Signavio dependency yet)

**Implemented:**
- `types.ts` — `LinkErrorCode` (the ten codes from the plan), `IDiagramLink`
  (`providerId`, `modelId`, normalised `imageUrl`, optional `hubUrl`), the discriminated
  union `LinkParseResult` and `IProcessToolProvider`. A provider returns `undefined` for
  input that is not its tool's, so the registry can ask the next one; a failure result
  means "mine, but invalid".
- `registry.ts` — `parseDiagramLink(input, providers = defaultProviders)`: accepts
  `undefined` (property pane values may be unset), trims, returns `empty` / the first
  claiming provider's result / `unsupported`. `defaultProviders` is still empty — Signavio
  is registered in F-001b.
- `registry.test.ts` — 6 tests with stub providers: empty/undefined/whitespace, no
  provider claims, no providers registered, first claim wins, trimmed input reaches the
  providers, provider order.

**Decisions / deviations:** none from the plan. `hubUrl` is optional in the contract
(other tools may have no interactive view); Signavio will always set it. The code is not
wired into the web part yet (F-002), so it is not part of the bundle.
