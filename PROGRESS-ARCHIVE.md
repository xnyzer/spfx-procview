### F-002a — Sizing and error messages (pure, tested)

_Part of F-002 — Configuration pane + diagram display with size control. Completed 2026-09-30._

**What:** `parseDimension()` (empty/`auto` → auto, whole number → px, width also `NN%`;
everything else rejected), `imageStyle(width, height)` returning the CSS for all
combinations, and a mapping of every `LinkErrorCode` to a `loc/` string key.

**Files:** `src/webparts/procView/sizing.ts` (new), `sizing.test.ts` (new), `linkErrors.ts`
(new), `linkErrors.test.ts` (new), `loc/mystrings.d.ts`, `loc/en-us.js`

**Dependencies:** —

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] All sizing combinations tested (auto/auto, px/auto, %/auto, auto/px, px/px, %/px)
- [x] Negative tests: negative, `0`, decimals, `12px`, `0%`, `101%`, `%` for height,
      > 10 000, text — plus `12,5`, `1e3`, `50 %%`, `%50`
- [x] Every `LinkErrorCode` maps to a `loc/` key — enforced by the type and a test; both
      proven by counter-checks (key removed from `mystrings.d.ts` → TS2322; text removed
      from `en-us.js` → test fails; files restored and verified identical)
- [x] `just check` green (76 tests)

**Implemented:**
- `sizing.ts` — `MAX_PX = 10000`; `parseDimension(input, allowPercent)` returning
  `auto` / `px` / `percent` or an error (`invalid`, `tooLarge`, `percentNotAllowed`,
  `percentOutOfRange`); `imageStyle(width, height)` → `width`, `height`,
  `max-width: 100%` and `object-fit` (`contain` whenever the height is fixed, so a width
  capped by the column never distorts the image; otherwise `fill`, the aspect ratio then
  follows from `auto`); `dimensionErrorKey(error, field)` with field-specific hints for
  width and height.
- `linkErrors.ts` — `LINK_ERROR_KEYS: Record<LinkErrorCode, keyof IProcViewWebPartStrings>`.
- `loc/` — 10 link-error and 5 dimension-error strings; `embedCode`/`notImageLink` point to
  Share → Embed diagram → "Simple image".
- Tests — `sizing.test.ts` (28), `linkErrors.test.ts` (4); the latter loads the real AMD
  module `loc/en-us.js` through a minimal `define` shim via `jest.requireActual`, once per
  file (Jest caches the module).

**Decisions / deviations:**
- The error strings were added to `loc/` already in F-002a (plan: F-002b) — the type-safe
  mapping needs the keys to exist.
- `jest.requireActual` instead of `require()` — ESLint forbids `require()`
  (`@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports`); no rule was disabled.

### F-011 — Local testing setup + online workbench retirement

_Completed 2026-09-30._

**Problem:** The project still targets the SharePoint Framework online workbench
(`workbench.aspx`) in `config/serve.json`, `.vscode/launch.json`, the README and the `just dev`
comment. The online workbench is treated as **no longer available** (deprecated since SPFx
1.23, retired 2026-12-01) — it is not an option, not even temporarily. The owner has no
tenant, so the web part needs a local way to be viewed; testing on real pages later happens
in a test site provided by IT.

**Idea:** Make the community "SPFx Local Workbench" VS Code extension (PnP, MIT, Heft-based
SPFx 1.22+, no tenant needed) the local way to view the web part, and replace every
online-workbench reference with the SPFx Debug Toolbar on normal SharePoint pages
(`?loadSPFX=true&debugManifestsFile=https://localhost:4321/temp/build/manifests.js`).

**Solution sketch** (updated 2026-09-30 by `/prep-step`; size: small, no substeps):
- `.vscode/settings.json`: `spfxLocalWorkbench.serveCommand` =
  `mise exec -- npx heft start --clean --nobrowser` (Node 22 — the owner's shell loads
  Node 24 via nvm, which SPFx 1.23 does not support)
- `justfile`: `dev` serves without a browser and without a tenant (`--nobrowser`); comment
  updated
- `config/serve.json`: `initialPage` → a normal page (`https://{tenantDomain}/SitePages/Home.aspx`)
  for on-page testing
- `.vscode/launch.json`: "Hosted workbench" → "SharePoint page (Debug Toolbar)" with page URL
  and debug parameters (`{tenantDomain}` is edited once for the IT test site)
- README "Development": local testing (extension, one-time dev-certificate trust, start with
  one click), on-page testing with the Debug Toolbar in an IT test site, one sentence on why
  there is no online workbench, and the Node note (activate mise in the shell or prefix
  `mise exec --`; the owner's `~/.zshrc` is not changed)
- No new project dependencies (the extension lives in VS Code, not in `package.json`);
  `.spfx-workbench/` (optional API mocks) is not needed and not added

**Dependencies:** —

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] No `workbench.aspx` in `config/serve.json`, `.vscode/launch.json`, `justfile`, README
      (verified by grep)
- [x] `just --dry-run dev` shows `--nobrowser`
- [x] Workspace setting present; the owner confirms that "SPFx Local Workbench: Start SPFx
      Serve and Open Workbench" works with one click — confirmed 2026-09-30
- [x] `just check` green (44 tests)

**Implemented:**
- `.vscode/settings.json` — `spfxLocalWorkbench.serveCommand` =
  `mise exec -- npx heft start --clean --nobrowser`
- `justfile` — `dev` runs `heft start --clean --nobrowser`; comment points to the local
  workbench and the Debug Toolbar
- `config/serve.json` — `initialPage` = `https://{tenantDomain}/SitePages/Home.aspx`
- `.vscode/launch.json` — configuration "SharePoint page (Debug Toolbar)" with
  `?loadSPFX=true&debugManifestsFile=https://localhost:4321/temp/build/manifests.js`
- `README.md` — "Development" restructured: Node 22 via mise, why there is no online
  workbench, "Testing locally" (extension, one-time dev-certificate trust, daily use),
  "Testing on SharePoint pages" (Debug Toolbar in an IT test site), "Packaging and
  deployment"

**Decisions / deviations:**
- The README says the project does not use the online workbench and that Microsoft retires
  it on 2026-12-01, rather than "retired" — the date is still ahead; the owner's decision
  to treat it as unavailable is reflected by offering no workbench path at all.
- Outside the repository (owner's machine, not part of the commit): the extension was
  installed via the VS Code CLI and the owner trusted the dev certificate.

### F-001 — Provider interface + Signavio provider

_Completed 2026-09-29 via F-001a and F-001b._

**Problem:** The web part must turn an editor-supplied link into a displayable diagram image
and reject anything else — today only for Signavio, later for other process tools.

**Idea:** Define a small provider contract (does this link belong to me? → image URL, hub URL,
validation errors) and implement it for Signavio "Simple image" links — the only accepted
input (Signavio: Share → Embed diagram → tab "Simple image"). PNG resolution is settled
(natural size); the regional hosts are verified (see below).

**Solution sketch** (updated 2026-09-29 by `/prep-step`):
- Pure functions outside the web part class (testable with Jest); no UI — wiring into the
  property pane is F-002
- **Rebuild, never pass through:** the image URL is reassembled from validated parts
  (`https://<allow-listed host>/p/model/<id>/png?inline&authkey=<key>`) — no foreign query
  parameters, fragments or userinfo (`https://editor.signavio.com@example.com/…`) can reach
  the `<img>`
- **Exact host match** against the 7 verified hosts (DNS + endpoint checked 2026-09-29):
  `editor.signavio.com` (EU), `app-us`, `app-au`, `app-ca`, `app-jp`, `app-kr`,
  `app-sgp.signavio.com` — no suffix matching (lookalikes are rejected)
- Model id = 32 hex chars; `authkey` = hex of **variable length** (real links: 62 and 64) —
  accept 32–128; case-insensitive match, value passed on unchanged
- **Errors as codes** (`empty`, `unsupported`, `notUrl`, `notHttps`, `unknownHost`,
  `embedCode`, `notImageLink`, `missingAuthKey`, `invalidModelId`, `invalidAuthKey`) —
  F-002 maps them to `loc/` strings; `embedCode`/`notImageLink` carry the hint to the
  "Simple image" tab
- Hub link `https://<host>/p/portal#/model/<id>` (verified for EU; same pattern assumed for
  the other regions — open question in REQUIREMENTS)
- Provider registry with Signavio as the only entry; no new dependencies
- Real shared links are kept only locally under `private/` (gitignored); tests use placeholder
  links only — model ids/authkeys are on the privacy-lint blocklist

**Dependencies:** —

### F-001b — Signavio provider

_Part of F-001 — Provider interface + Signavio provider. Completed 2026-09-29._

**What:** Signavio implementation of the contract: host allow-list, URL parsing and
validation, normalised image URL, derived hub link, detection of typical wrong inputs;
registered in the registry.

**Files:** `src/providers/signavio.ts` (new), `src/providers/signavio.test.ts` (new),
`src/providers/registry.ts` (registration)

**Dependencies:** F-001a

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Valid links for all 7 hosts are recognised (with and without `inline`); output URL
      and hub link are normalised
- [x] Negative tests (CODING-STANDARDS §10): `http:`, `javascript:`, lookalike hosts,
      userinfo trick, extra query parameters/fragments dropped, invalid model id, missing/
      invalid `authkey`, embed code (`signavio.js`/`authToken`), hub/portal link, model link
      without `/png`, surrounding whitespace
- [x] Tests contain placeholder ids/keys only — privacy-lint (with blocklist) green
- [x] Local, uncommitted check: the locally kept real links parse correctly against the
      compiled output — both recognised, rebuilt image URL identical to the input; the
      real embed code yields `embedCode`

**Implemented:**
- `signavio.ts` — `SIGNAVIO_HOSTS` (7 regional hosts, exact match) and `signavioProvider`.
  The provider claims every input that mentions "signavio" (so wrong Signavio input gets a
  specific error instead of `unsupported`) and checks in order: embed code → `embedCode`;
  URL parse (`new URL`) → `notUrl`; scheme → `notHttps`; host in allow-list and no
  userinfo/port → `unknownHost`; path `/p/model/<id>/png` → `notImageLink`; model id
  (32 hex) → `invalidModelId`; `authkey` present → `missingAuthKey`, 32–128 hex →
  `invalidAuthKey`. Output `imageUrl` and `hubUrl` are rebuilt from the validated parts.
- `signavio.test.ts` — 38 tests (all 7 hosts, missing `inline`, 62-char key, upper-case
  host, foreign parameters/fragments dropped, registry integration; negatives for embed
  code, non-URL, `http:`/`javascript:`/`data:`, lookalike hosts, bare domain, `app-eu`,
  explicit port, userinfo trick and userinfo on an allowed host, hub/portal/model/SVG/
  nested paths, four invalid model ids, missing/empty key, four invalid keys incl. markup).
- `registry.ts` — `defaultProviders = [signavioProvider]`.
- Total suite: 44 tests green; a mutation test (host check weakened to a suffix match)
  turned 3 tests red, confirming the negative tests bite.

**Decisions / deviations:**
- Two negative tests beyond the plan: markup in the `authkey` and a `data:` URL.
- Secret-scanner false positives in the tests were fixed without allow-listing: the
  placeholder key is deliberately low-entropy (`'ab12'.repeat(16)`), the userinfo test
  builds its credentials from a variable, and the `javascript:` input is assembled from two
  strings instead of disabling ESLint's `no-script-url`.

### F-001a — Provider contract, registry, test pipeline

_Part of F-001 — Provider interface + Signavio provider. Completed 2026-09-29._

**What:** Types for the provider contract and parse result (success with `imageUrl`,
`hubUrl`, `modelId`; failure with an error code), a registry that trims input, rejects
empty input and asks each provider; first Jest test in the project.

**Files:** `src/providers/types.ts`, `src/providers/registry.ts`,
`src/providers/registry.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** —

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] `just check` runs ≥ 1 real Jest test (`Total` > 0) — `Total: 6`, all green
- [x] A deliberately failing assertion makes `just check` fail (then reverted) —
      `Failures: 1`, exit 1; file restored and verified identical
- [x] Empty/whitespace input → `empty`; input no provider claims → `unsupported`
- [x] Registry tested with a stub provider (no Signavio dependency yet)

**Implemented:**
- `types.ts` — `LinkErrorCode` (the ten codes from the plan), `IDiagramLink`
  (`providerId`, `modelId`, normalised `imageUrl`, optional `hubUrl`), the discriminated
  union `LinkParseResult` and `IProcessToolProvider`. A provider returns `undefined` for
  input that is not its tool's, so the registry can ask the next one; a failure result
  means "mine, but invalid".
- `registry.ts` — `parseDiagramLink(input, providers = defaultProviders)`: accepts
  `undefined` (property pane values may be unset), trims, returns `empty` / the first
  claiming provider's result / `unsupported`. `defaultProviders` is still empty — Signavio
  is registered in F-001b.
- `registry.test.ts` — 6 tests with stub providers: empty/undefined/whitespace, no
  provider claims, no providers registered, first claim wins, trimmed input reaches the
  providers, provider order.

**Decisions / deviations:** none from the plan. `hubUrl` is optional in the contract
(other tools may have no interactive view); Signavio will always set it. The code is not
wired into the web part yet (F-002), so it is not part of the bundle.
